# Savoury cake

## Ingredients

### Base
- 200g flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 7cl olive oil *(if using sundried tomatoes: reuse the oil from the jar!)*
- 4 eggs
- 125ml milk (half a cup)
- salt
- pepper
- 100g grated cheese such as Emmental or Cheddar *(optional)*

### Fillings

The base is the same for all cakes, it's up to you to pick what you want to put in it! The most common pairings are sundried tomatoes and feta, or ham cubes and green olives, or blue cheese and walnuts for a fancy version.

But the beauty of it is that you can be creative and use what you have! Here's some ideas:

- olives, pitted, cut in half
- chorizo
- diced cheese: mozzarella, feta, goat's cheese or even blue cheese
- sundried tomatoes
- sautéed courgettes, aubergines or mushrooms
- lardons
- walnuts
- tuna
- …

## Directions

- Preheat oven to 180 ℃.
- In a large bowl, mix in the flour and baking powder.
- Incorporate the rest of the ingredients (for the base) and whisk thoroughly until you get a homogenous mixture (it should be quite wet, it's not the same texture as a bread dough).
- Add in the ingredients you've chosen for your fillings.
- Generously grease a baking dish or rectangular cake mould, then pour in the mixture you've just done.
- Bake for about 40 minutes. It may take less time depending on how large your dish is (and how deep the dough is), so keep an eye on it after 25 minutes. Check with a knife towards the end to ensure the inside is cooked — if the top crust browns too fast, tent it with foil.
- Leave to rest for a few minutes then remove from the dish and cut slices.
