# Butterbredele

*Butterbredele are the most common kind of bredele, small biscuits eaten around Christmas time in Alsace, France and in Switzerland.*

## Ingredients

- 500g flour
- 250g butter
- 250g caster sugar
- 1 pack of vanilla sugar (or 1 tbsp vanilla extract)
- 2 eggs
- 1 egg yolk

You will also need cookie cutters of various shapes (ideally Christmassy ones). [This](https://www.my-week-end-in-alsace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/butterbredele.jpg) is what we're aiming for.
 
## Method

1. Mix in the butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla to get a white-ish dough. Add the flour, and leave to rest in the fridge for about 3 hours.

2. Spread the dough with a rolling pin, about 3 mm in thickness. Cut shapes with cookie cutters until there's no space left, then re-roll again.

3. Preheat your oven to 200 â„ƒ. With a brush, glaze the biscuits with the egg yolk. Bake for about 10 minutes on a greased sheet, watching closely.  
The biscuits should still be slightly soft after that time; they will continue drying out once you take them out of the oven, so if you wait until they're perfectly done in the oven then they'll be too dry and hard later on!

4. If possible place them on a drying rack, and go on to do the next batch (they probably won't fit all at once in your oven). Once dry, eat some while they're still warm, and put the rest in an airtight container - they can keep for months. You can dip them in coffee or hot chocolate.
