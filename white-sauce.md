# White sauce

This is a cold sauce, traditionally used with kebabs or barbecues but can be used as a dip for crudit√©s or as a dressing for salads.

## Ingredients

* 8 tbsp Greek or Turkish yoghurt
* 2 tbsp mayonnaise
* juice of half a lime (or lemon)
* 1 small shallot (or half of a big one), halved and very thinly sliced
* a bit of milk

Seasoning (adjust to taste):
* 5-6 fresh mint leaves, crushed then cut into tiny strips with scissors
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp cumin
* salt and pepper

You can also consider adding chopped parsley, a pinch of mild chili powder or flakes, 1 tsp of powdered garlic, and/or Herbes de Provence.

## Preparation

Mix everything but the milk in a bowl, then progressively add milk until you reach the desired consistency.

You can make a green version by mixing in a tablespoon of pesto.
