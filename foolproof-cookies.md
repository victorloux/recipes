# Foolproof cookies

## Ingredients

- 125g butter (and a bit more for greasing)
- 100g brown sugar
- 100g white sugar
- vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 225g white flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 100g chocolate chips
- 100g dried raisins/pecan nut (if you don't like these replace with 50g more chocolate)

## Directions

- Preheat oven to 180º C. Soften the butter in a small pot, working it with a spatula, then stir in the sugars. Whip the mixture until it becomes foamy.
- Add a few drops of vanilla extract and the egg. Stir. Aside, mix the dry ingredients — flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt. Add it in small batches to the first, wet mixture. Add the raisins or nuts last, without working the dough too much.
- Make the cookie shapes. You should use very little dough for each; use only a tablespoon for each cookie. With wet hands, roll that into a small ball, then flatten it with the palm of your hands to a shape just under a centimeter thick. Don't try to flatten them too much; they will expand in the oven, so if they're too thin they will burn and merge into each other. Space them out generously on greased baking sheets.
- Bake in batches, for 10-12 minutes each. Timing will depend on your oven and how thick you made them, so watch them towards the end to make sure they're not overcooking. They will still be a bit soft when they're done; leave them to dry on a rack if you have one, and once they've hardened after a few minutes put them all in a jar or box.
