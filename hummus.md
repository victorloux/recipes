# Hummus

## Ingredients

*Note*: you need a food processor for this recipe

- 1 can (400g) chickpeas **(do not drain yet)**
- 2 tbsp tahini (sesame paste)
- 1-2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed under a knife
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- a good pinch of cumin and coriander (or better if you have it: za’atar)
- a pinch salt
- some extra virgin olive oil
- harissa paste (optional)

Start by draining the juice from the chickpeas can into a glass — **do not throw that juice away**. Put the chickpeas and all ingredients (except the oil and harissa) into the food processor, add a little bit of the chickpea juice, and start blitzing. Progressively add more of the reserved chickpea juice until you reach the desired consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking — it will take a few tries before you find the perfect lemon/garlic/tahini/herbs combo for you.

Put into a bowl, swirl in a teaspoon of harissa, and pour a little bit of olive oil over the harissa. Serve with pitta bread, vegetable sticks, or use as a sandwich spread.

## Tips

**For a fancy service**: decorate the top of the bowl with whole chickpeas (that you put aside before blitzing the rest), a couple of coriander leaves (mint works too), and sprinkle some paprika over.

If your hummus ever **gets too thin** because you accidentally put too much liquid, you can try to salvage it using a few tablespoons of chickpea flour (gram dissolved in hot water to thicken it. It modifies the texture so can be worth experimenting with that on purpose — [some recipes](http://www.food.com/recipe/pudla-besan-chickpea-pancake-460196) even do the whole thing from flour instead of crushed chickpeas.
