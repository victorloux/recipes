# Tarte flambée / Flàmmeküeche

*The Flàmmeküeche is one of the emblematic dishes of the region of Alsace, in France. Unlike what the French translation would suggest, it is not flambéed (in alcohol), but “brushed by the flames”, as it was originally cooked in traditional brick ovens. It could be described as a very thin pizza covered with cream, lardons and onions.*

## Ingredients

### For the dough

- 250g flour
- 120ml lukewarm water
- 3cl (a tablespoon) of vegetable oil
- salt

There are many variations on ways to make the dough, but remember that the dough has to be very thin and crispy; unlike pizza or bread dough, it should not rise much, so do not put any yeast in there.

This makes two medium *tartes*; adapt the proportions as needed, but you’ll want about two thirds flour to a third of water.

### For the topping

- A tub of **fromage blanc**, a sort of creamy soft cheese. You will usually have a hard time finding this outwith France or Belgium, so now that I live in the UK I generally replace it with a mix of half crème fraîche, and another half of either of these:
	- **Greek yoghurt**
	- **Mascarpone** (if using that, you could probably do away with using mostly well-whipped mascarpone and less crème fraîche)
	- **quark** or **cottage cheese** (same note as mascarpone; these are closer to real fromage blanc)
	- **Turkish yoghurt** with extra milk to thin it
- 1 big (or 2 medium) **yellow onions**, halved and very thinly sliced
- 250g of **lardons**. You might sometimes find these sold as “bacon cubes” in the UK; if you do not find it you could use pancetta, although it is not quite the same. *See below for vegetarian alternatives.*

**For serving**: a green salad (rocket or lamb’s lettuce is good), with a light French dressing and very thinly sliced shallots. Serve with white wine (…Alsatian, obviously), a good lager, or sparkling water.

### Variants

- **Forestière (vegetarian)**: in place of the lardons, 100 grams of sliced mushrooms sautéed in butter before putting them on the dish
- **Leeks and mushroom (vegetarian)**: 2 small leeks, cut into ¼ inch slices and with the rings then pushed out; and 100 grams of sliced mushrooms. Both quickly pre-cooked/sautéed before adding them.
- **Gratinée**: add grated gruyère on the final dish.

These are the most common variants, but be free to invent more! Sweet versions for desert also exist, generally using apples slices.

## Making the dough

Start by mixing the flour and salt in a large bowl, then make a pit in the middle and add half of the water. With a wooden spoon, start folding the flour over onto the water. Once it is mixed in, add the rest of the water. Knead with wet hands (keep wetting your hands to avoid the dough from sticking) for about ten minutes: it will look very floury and dry at the beginning it, but after some effort you should end up with a consistent, yellow-ish dough.

Add the tablespoon of oil and knead again until blended in; then spread the dough into two balls and knead again. They should feel very elastic, not easily break down, and look like this:

You do not need to leave the dough to prove, as there's no yeast. You can either use it immediately, or make it a day ahead: put the dough balls in a bowl covered with cling film in the fridge, and take out 30 minutes before using.

## Putting it together

Preheat your oven to the maximum possible temperature (240 ℃ or higher if it will go higher). If possible set on the conventional mode rather than fan-assisted; remember this was originally made in a brick oven.

On a baking sheet, spread a bit of flour and lay your first ball of dough. With a rolling pin, spread it thinly (about the thickness of a £1 coin) in a large rectangular shape. It is thinner than a regular pizza, hence why your dough should be elastic.

That’s most of the work done! Now with a tablespoon, spread the cream base over (leaving a little bit of space on the edges), then evenly lay out your toppings: first the lardons (or mushrooms/leeks), then the onions. If you are doing the vegetarian alternatives you can sprinkle with a good pinch of salt; the traditional version will already be well salted thanks to the lardons.

Now put in the middle of the oven. You will have to watch it: cooking times can vary between 6 and 12 minutes, depending on how powerful your oven is and how thinly you spread the dough. Fit a spatula under the base and try to lift the tart to get a feel of how cooked it is.

When the base is solid and crispy and the top of the onions are lightly charred, take out, transfer onto a large wooden chopping board, and let it rest for a few minutes (it will be very hot!). Slice into even rectangles and serve. Just like with Italian pizza, you would be committing a terrible faux pas if you used a fork to eat it: that’s what your fingers are for!
